# Register no: 212222240101
# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# Tools Required: 
Python, Command Line Interface, AI Prompt Design Concepts

# Procedure:
```
Defined the goal to create a Personal Productivity Assistant that responds to user prompts naturally.

Identified core features like task manager, reminders, wellness tips, and greetings.

Designed sample prompts such as “Add task finish project,” “Remind me to call mom at 9 PM,” and “Give me a wellness tip.”

Implemented the logic in Python using conditional statements to process prompts and generate responses.

Simulated user interaction through a command-line interface to accept natural language inputs.

Added simple memory to store user preferences like name and wellness tips.

Executed and tested the application to verify correct responses for each prompt.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:

 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.

 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.

 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.

 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
